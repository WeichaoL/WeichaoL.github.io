<li><font size="2"> Practical work for first-year students of the MSc in Electrical Engineering and the MSc in Energy, 12h x 2.</font></li>
<li><font size="2"> The objective of this
practical work is to allow students to understand information processing by source coding, using MATLAB
simulation software. More precisely, the goal of the first session is to familiarize students with compressing
data (texts, sound signals and grayscale images) with Huffman coding. The goal of the second session is
to familiarize students with the three blocks of the JPEG image encoder (transformation block, quantizer
and entropy encoder). The goal of the third session is to show the interest of predictive coding and motion
compensation in a context of video compression. </font></li>

The objective of this practical work is to allow students to understand and use MATLAB simulation software
from the perspective of dynamic system analysis, and design control laws for univariate or multivariable
linear systems.</font></li>
