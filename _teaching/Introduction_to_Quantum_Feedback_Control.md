<li><font size="2"> Course for Ph.D. students and researchers working in the field of control theory or mathematical
physics, 18h.</font></li>
<li><font size="2"> This course firstly introduces the
stochastic filtering theory and the quantum filtering theory in order to derive the time evolution of the state
of an open quantum system interacting with an environment. </font></li>
<li><font size="2"> Then, we study the problem of the feedback
exponential stabilization of $N$-level spin systems undesrgoing continuous-time measurements with the known
and unknown initial states.</font></li>
